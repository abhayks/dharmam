# What is Shruti?

**Shruti** (Sanskrit: श्रुति, "that which is heard") refers to the body of most authoritative, ancient religious texts comprising the central canon of Hinduism. 

Unlike other texts, Shruti is considered **Apauruseya** (not created by humans) and **Nitya** (eternal). These sounds were "heard" by ancient Rishis (sages) in deep states of meditation and passed down orally through generations with precise intonation.

## The Four Divisions

Shruti is primarily categorized into the four Vedas, and each Veda is further divided into four sections:

1.  **Samhitas:** The core mantras and benedictions.
2.  **Brahmanas:** Rituals, prayers, and instructions for ceremonies.
3.  **Aranyakas:** The "forest texts" concerning worship and meditation.
4.  **Upanishads:** The philosophical and spiritual essence (Vedanta).
