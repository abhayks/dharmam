# The Vedas

The word **Veda** comes from the root *vid*, meaning "to know". It literally means "Knowledge".

The Vedas are considered **Apauruseya** (not of human agency). They are the breath of the Eternal, revealed to the Rishis (seers) in deep meditation.

## The Four Vedas
1. **Rigveda:** The collection of hymns and mantras.
2. **Yajurveda:** The book of rituals and sacrificial formulas.
3. **Samaveda:** The book of song and melody.
4. **Atharvaveda:** The book of daily life, procedures, and healing.
