*Hotaram ratnadhatamam*

---

## Translation

I glorify **Agni** (ile), who is:

1.  **Purohitam:** The High Priest of the sacrifice (who leads us forward).
2.  **Yajnasya Devam:** The divine illuminator of the Yajna.
3.  **Rtvijam:** The divine ministrant who performs the rite at the right time.
4.  **Hotaram:** The Summoner (who calls the gods to us).
5.  **Ratnadhatamam:** The greatest holder of gems (spiritual and material wealth).

## Commentary

This mantra speaks not just of the physical fire, but of the **Spiritual Fire** (the flame of consciousness).

### 1. Purohit
The word 'Purohit' means *Pura-Hitam* (placed in the front). Agni is placed first in every auspicious act. Just as a guide shows us the path, Agni elevates our consciousness.

### 2. Ratnadhatamam
This is the most beautiful epithet of Agni. Agni is the bestower of **gems**.
* **Materially:** Health, wealth, and prosperity.
* **Spiritually:** The gems of wisdom, discrimination, and self-realization.

### Conclusion
When we kindle the internal fire of wisdom, it burns away our ignorance and fills us with divine qualities. This is the first message of Sanatana Dharma—to move towards the light.
