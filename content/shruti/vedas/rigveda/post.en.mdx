# The Knowledge of Verses

The **Rigveda** (Sanskrit: ऋग्वेद from *ṛc* "praise" and *veda* "knowledge") is an ancient Indian collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns. It is one of the four sacred canonical texts (Śruti) of Hinduism.

It is the oldest known Vedic Sanskrit text. Its early layers are one of the oldest extant texts in any Indo-European language. The sounds and verses of the Rigveda have been recited orally with precise intonation for over 3,000 years.

* **Total Hymns (Suktas):** 1,028
