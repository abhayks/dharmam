# Dhyana Yoga (The Yoga of Meditation)

## Introduction

In this chapter, Lord Krishna explains the path of *Dhyana Yoga* (Yoga of Meditation), also known as *Atma Samyama Yoga* (Yoga of Self-Control). He describes the techniques of meditation, the importance of controlling the mind, and the state of a perfected yogi. This chapter provides practical guidance for those seeking to quiet the mind and realize the Divine within.

## Chapter Summary

Krishna starts by redefining the true Sannyasi and Yogi as one who performs their duties without attachment to the results. He emphasizes that the mind can be either our best friend or our worst enemy, depending on whether we have conquered it.

The chapter details the physical and mental preparations for meditation: choosing a clean, solitary spot; maintaining a steady posture; and focusing the gaze. Krishna explains that moderation in eating, sleeping, and work is essential for success in Yoga.

Arjuna expresses his concern about the restless nature of the mind, famously comparing it to trying to control the wind. Krishna reassures him that the mind can be brought under control through constant practice (*Abhyasa*) and detachment (*Vairagya*).

The chapter concludes with Arjuna asking about the fate of those who fail on the path of Yoga. Krishna promises that no good effort is ever lost and that such seekers will eventually attain perfection in future lives.

## Key Themes

*   **Mind Control:** Understanding the mind as a tool that needs discipline.
*   **Abhyasa and Vairagya:** The two pillars of spiritual practice—persistence and detachment.
*   **The Equanimous Mind:** Seeing the same Divinity in all circumstances and beings.
*   **Moderation:** The "Middle Path" in all daily activities.
*   **The Grace for Seekers:** Assurance that spiritual progress is never wasted.

## Significance of the Chapter

Chapter 6 is the most practical chapter for those interested in the formal practice of meditation. It bridges the gap between active Karma Yoga and the deeper internal state of Samadhi. It teaches that while the path is challenging, it is accessible to anyone willing to put in the effort with faith and patience.
