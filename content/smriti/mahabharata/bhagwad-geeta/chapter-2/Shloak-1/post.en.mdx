## Description
**2.1**

The mighty bowman stood in tears,<br />
His heart by sudden pity torn;<br />
To see his kinsmen facing death,<br />
He felt a grief too heavy, born.

His eyes were filled with sorrow's stream,<br />
His spirit sunk in gloom and pain;<br />
How could he strike the ones he loved,<br />
For earthly power or royal gain?

Then Madhusudana, the Lord,<br />
Who slew the demon of the mind,<br />
Prepared to speak the words of light,<br />
To leave this darkness far behind.
