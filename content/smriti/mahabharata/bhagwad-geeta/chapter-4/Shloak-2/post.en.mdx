<ShlokaCard
  sanskrit="एवं परम्पराप्राप्तमिमं राजर्षयो विदुः ।\nस कालेनेह महता योगे नष्टः परन्तप ॥ ४-२॥"
  en="This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way. But in course of time the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost."
  hi="हे परंतप अर्जुन! इस प्रकार परम्परा से प्राप्त इस योगको राजर्षियों ने जाना, किन्तु उसके बाद वह योग बहुत काल से इस पृथ्वीलोक में लुप्तप्राय हो गया।"

## Description
**4.2**

Handed down thus, from king to king,<br />
The saintly royals knew this sacred thing.<br />
But time has hidden it, broken the chain,<br />
Restoring this truth is My aim again.
