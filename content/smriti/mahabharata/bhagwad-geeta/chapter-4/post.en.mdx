# Jnana Karma Sannyasa Yoga (The Yoga of Knowledge)

## Introduction

In this chapter, Lord Krishna reveals the ancient history of the knowledge He is imparting. He explains the principles behind His divine incarnations (Avatara) and further elaborates on the intricate nature of action (Karma), inaction (Akarma), and forbidden action (Vikarma). The chapter's title signifies the culmination of action in the wisdom of transcendental knowledge.

## Chapter Summary

Krishna begins by stating that He taught this imperishable science of yoga to the sun-god Vivasvan, who then passed it down through a lineage of saintly kings. He explains that whenever and wherever there is a decline in righteousness and a rise of irreligion, He descends Himself to protect the virtuous and annihilate the wicked.

He then delves deeper into Karma Yoga, explaining that one who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction, is truly intelligent. Such a person acts without attachment, their actions "burned" by the fire of transcendental knowledge, thus incurring no karmic reactions.

Krishna describes various types of sacrifices (Yajnas) that spiritual seekers perform to purify themselves, concluding that the sacrifice performed in knowledge is superior to the mere sacrifice of material possessions. He advises Arjuna to approach a self-realized spiritual master, inquire from him submissively, and render service to him to gain this divine knowledge, which is the ultimate purifier.
