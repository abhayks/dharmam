# The Pandava Brothers' Conch Blasts

The declaration of war continued as the other Pandava brothers sounded their conches.

King Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, also known as Dharmaraja, blew his conch, the **Anantavijaya** (eternal victory). Nakula blew the **Sughosha** (sweet sound), and Sahadeva blew the **Manipushpaka** (jewel-flowered). Through their conch blasts, all the brothers demonstrated their full participation and firm resolve in the battle.
