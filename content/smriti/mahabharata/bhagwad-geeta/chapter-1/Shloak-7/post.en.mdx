# Assessing Own Strength

Having listed the formidable warriors of the enemy, Duryodhana now turns to his own side. He addresses Dronacharya as **Dwijottama** (Best of the Twice-born/Brahmins). 

He wants to remind Drona that although Drona is a Brahmin by birth, he is the commander here. It is also an attempt to reassure himself by reciting the names of the powerful generals on his side.

<ShlokaCard 
  sanskrit="अस्माकं तु विशिष्टा ये तान्निबोध द्विजोत्तम ।
नायका मम सैन्यस्य संज्ञार्थं तान्ब्रवीमि ते ॥"
  en="But know those who are the most distinguished amongst us, O best of Brahmins. For your information, I shall recount the leaders of my army."
  hi="हे द्विजश्रेष्ठ! अपने पक्ष में भी जो प्रधान हैं, उनको आप समझ लीजिये। आपकी जानकारी के लिए मेरी सेना के जो-जो सेनापति हैं, उनको बतलाता हूँ।"

## Description
**1.7**

His eyes withdrew from the opposing line,<br />
Where fear and awe had begun to intertwine.<br />
To settle the trembling within his chest,<br />
He looked to the warriors he loved the best.

"Enough of them," the prince declared,<br />
"Let me speak of how *we* are prepared.<br />
O Best of Brahmins, hear me now,<br />
To our own strength, let us bow.

Why should I fear the sons of Pandu’s race,<br />
When I have titans in this place?<br />
For your sake, Master, and for my own,<br />
I shall name the pillars of my throne.

Listen well to the names I speak,<br />
They are not mild, they are not weak.<br />
These are the captains of my might,<br />
Who shall burn the world in the coming fight."
