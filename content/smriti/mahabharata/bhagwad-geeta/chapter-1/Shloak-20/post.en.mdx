# Arjuna's Request at the Outset of War

O King (Dhritarashtra), at that moment, with both armies facing each other and the clash of weapons imminent, Arjuna, the son of Pandu, seated in his chariot adorned with the flag of Hanuman, observed the Kauravas.

Seeing them arrayed and ready for battle, he lifted his Gandiva bow and spoke these words to Lord Krishna (Hrishikesha). This is a pivotal moment that marks the beginning of the Gita's teachings, where Arjuna transitions from a warrior to a seeker of knowledge.

<ShlokaCard 
  sanskrit="अथ व्यवस्थितान्दृष्ट्वा धार्तराष्ट्रान् कपिध्वजः ।
प्रवृत्ते शस्त्रसम्पाते धनुरुद्यम्य पाण्डवः ।
हृषीकेशं तदा वाक्यमिदमाह महीपते ॥"
  en="O King, at that time, Arjuna, the son of Pandu, seated in the chariot bearing the flag of Hanuman, took up his bow and prepared to shoot. After looking at the sons of Dhritarashtra drawn in military array, Arjuna then spoke to Lord Krishna."
  hi="हे राजन्! इसके बाद कपिध्वज अर्जुन ने मोर्चा बाँधकर डटे हुए धृतराष्ट्र-सम्बन्धियों को देखकर, उस शस्त्र-संचालन की तैयारी के समय धनुष उठाकर हृषीकेश श्रीकृष्ण महाराज से यह वचन कहा।"

## Commentary
**1.20**

Until this point, Arjuna was a determined warrior, fully prepared for battle. He had lifted his bow, a symbol of his readiness. But upon seeing the Kauravas—his own kinsmen—arrayed for war, the first seed of doubt was planted in his mind. It is at this moment that he turns to his charioteer and guide, Lord Krishna, and the true dialogue of the Bhagavad Gita begins.
