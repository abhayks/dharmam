# The Uproar of the Kaurava Army

Immediately after Grandsire Bhishma's powerful conch blast, a wave of excitement surged through the entire Kaurava army. Responding to Bhishma's declaration, the soldiers began to play their instruments.

Suddenly, thousands of conches, kettledrums, tabors, drums, and trumpets blared forth all at once. The combined sound was exceedingly tumultuous and chaotic, echoing across the entire battlefield. This uproar demonstrated the vast numbers of the Kauravas and their collective enthusiasm for the war.

## Commentary
**1.13**

Bhishma's roar awakened the dormant Kaurava force. In response to his single call, a cacophony of a thousand instruments erupted. The sharp sound of conches, the thunder of drums, and the call of trumpets created a noise that pierced the sky. It was a demonstration of their might, a sound designed to strike fear into the heart of any enemy.
