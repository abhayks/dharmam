# The Chief Warriors' Conch Blasts

Following Lord Krishna and Arjuna, the other prominent warriors of the Pandava army joined in the declaration of war by blowing their conches.

Lord Krishna, also known as **Hrishikesha** (the master of the senses), blew His conch named **Panchajanya**. Arjuna, known as **Dhananjaya** (the winner of wealth), blew his conch, the **Devadatta**. And Bhima, the performer of herculean tasks, also called **Vrikodara**, blew his great conch, the **Paundra**. Each conch had its own special name and history, reflecting the greatness of its bearer.

## Commentary
**1.15**

Three primary sounds echoed from the Pandava side. The sound of Krishna's Panchajanya was divine, signaling the establishment of dharma. The sound of Arjuna's Devadatta declared the resolve for victory. And the roar of Bhima's Paundra was meant to strike terror into the hearts of the enemy. Together, they created a symphony that symbolized the power of the side of justice.
