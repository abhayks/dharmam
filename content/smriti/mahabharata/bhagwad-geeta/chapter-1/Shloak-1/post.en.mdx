# The Blind King's Anxiety

The Bhagavad Gita opens not with Krishna or Arjuna, but with the blind King Dhritarashtra. Blind physically and spiritually, he asks his advisor Sanjaya to describe the events of the war.

<ShlokaCard 
  sanskrit="धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे समवेता युयुत्सवः ।
मामकाः पाण्डवाश्चैव किमकुर्वत सञ्जय ॥"
  en="O Sanjaya, assembled in the holy land of Kurukshetra, desirous to fight, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do?"
  hi="हे संजय! धर्मभूमि कुरुक्षेत्र में एकत्रित, युद्ध की इच्छा वाले मेरे और पाण्डु के पुत्रों ने क्या किया?"

## Description
**1.1**

In all the Gita’s sacred song,<br />
One verse alone the blind king spoke;<br />
Thereafter Sanjaya’s solemn voice<br />
Revealed the war through destiny’s smoke.

Old Dhritarashtra, burdened deep,<br />
Knew well the wrongs his heart had sown—<br />
The Pandavas, denied their right,<br />
The seeds of sin he called his own.

He knew the might of gathered hosts,<br />
The thunder of each battle line;<br />
He trusted still his son’s vast ranks,<br />
Yet felt a tremor—half-divine.

For guilt, like shadow, pressed his chest;<br />
Fate’s whisper chilled his secret breath.<br />
He feared the end that lay ahead,<br />
The judgment born of war and death.

Thus to Sanjaya he proclaimed:<br />
“What rose upon Kurukshetra’s plain?”<br />
For Vyasa, sage of timeless sight,<br />
Had blessed the seer with vision’s flame—<br />
To watch the clash of righteous steel,<br />
To hear each cry, each warrior’s name,<br />
And speak the story to the king,<br />
While destiny fulfilled its claim.
