# A Reeling Mind and Unsteady Body

Arjuna's agony intensifies. He says, "My Gandiva bow is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning all over. I am unable to stand here any longer, and my mind is utterly confused."

The great warrior Arjuna, known for his stability and focus, can no longer even stand on his own feet. His mind, once laser-focused on the target, is now trapped in a maze of confusion.

<ShlokaCard 
  sanskrit="गाण्डीवं स्रंसते हस्तात्त्वक्चैव परिदह्यते ।
न च शक्नोम्यवस्थातुं भ्रमतीव च मे मनः ॥"
  en="The Gandiva bow is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning all over. I am now unable to stand here any longer, and my mind is reeling."
  hi="हाथ से गाण्डीव धनुष गिर रहा है और त्वचा भी बहुत जल रही है तथा मेरा मन भ्रमित-सा हो रहा है, इसलिए मैं खड़ा रहने को भी समर्थ नहीं हूँ।"

## Commentary
**1.30**

This shloka marks the peak of Arjuna's breakdown. "Bhramatīva ca me manaḥ" (my mind is reeling) shows that he has lost his ability to discern between right and wrong. Both his body and mind have given up. This is a state of complete helplessness, which will prepare him to take refuge in Krishna. Only when a person accepts their limitations are they ready for divine guidance.
