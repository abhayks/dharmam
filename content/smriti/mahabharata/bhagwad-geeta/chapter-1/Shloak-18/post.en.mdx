# The Next Generation's Call

Along with the senior warriors of the Pandava side, the younger generation also announced their participation in the war.

King Drupada, the father of Draupadi; the five sons of Draupadi (Prativindhya, Sutasoma, Shrutakarma, Satanika, and Shrutasena); and the valiant son of Arjuna, the mighty-armed Abhimanyu—all of them, O Lord of the Earth (Dhritarashtra), blew their respective conches. This shows that this war was not just of one generation; the next generation was also ready to fight for the protection of dharma.

सौभद्रश्च महाबाहुः शङ्खान्दध्मुः पृथक्पृथक् ॥"

## Commentary
**1.18**

Sanjaya emphasizes the gravity of the war by telling Dhritarashtra that even the youth, like the sons of Draupadi and Abhimanyu, have joined the battle. This was not just a conflict between kingdoms but also of families, where fathers, sons, and grandsons stood together for a common cause. It highlights the unity of the Pandava side and the sanctity of their purpose.
