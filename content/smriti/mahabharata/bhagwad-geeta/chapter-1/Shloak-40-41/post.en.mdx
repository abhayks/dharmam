# The Collapse of Lineage

Arjuna presents a sociological argument here. He believes that war kills the male protectors of the family. Without protection and guidance, the family structure crumbles, leading to **Adharma** (lawlessness).

He argues that this leads to **Varna-sankara** (unwanted or unsupported progeny). In the Vedic tradition, specific rites (**Pinda** and **Udaka**—food and water) are offered to ancestors to keep their souls at peace. Arjuna fears that a chaotic society, disconnected from tradition, will stop performing these rites, causing the ancestors to "fall" into misery.

स्त्रीषु दुष्टासु वार्ष्णेय जायते वर्णसङ्करः ॥"
  en="O Krishna, when irreligion is prominent in the family, the women of the family become polluted, and from the degradation of womanhood, O descendant of Vrishni, comes unwanted progeny."
  hi="हे कृष्ण! पाप के अधिक बढ़ जाने से कुल की स्त्रियाँ दूषित हो जाती हैं और हे वार्ष्णेय! स्त्रियों के दूषित होने पर वर्णशंकर उत्पन्न होता है।"

  sanskrit="सङ्करो नरकायैव कुलघ्नानां कुलस्य च ।
पतन्ति पितरो ह्येषां लुप्तपिण्डोदकक्रियाः ॥"
  en="An increase of unwanted population certainly causes hellish life both for the family and for those who destroy the family. Deprived of the ritual offerings of food and water, their ancestors fall down."
  hi="वर्णशंकर कुलघातियों को और कुल को नरक में ले जाने के लिये ही होता है। लुप्त हुई पिण्ड और जल की क्रिया वाले अर्थात् श्राद्ध और तर्पण से वंचित इनके पितर लोग भी अधोगति को प्राप्त होते हैं।"

## Description
**1.40 – 1.41**

"When the guardians die in the bloody fray,<br />
The laws of the family melt away.<br />
When protection fails and morals fade,<br />
The honor of the house is soon betrayed.

From this confusion, a generation springs,<br />
That knows not the sacredness of things.<br />
Unwanted, unguided, they roam the earth,<br />
Cutting the roots of their noble birth.

And what of the souls who watch from above?<br />
Waiting for offerings given in love.<br />
When the rites of the Pinda and water cease,<br />
The ancestors fall from their state of peace.

A family broken, a lineage lost,<br />
O Krishna, tell me, is this worth the cost?<br />
To damn our fathers to the dark below,<br />
Is this the glory that victors know?"
