# The Strength of the Kaurava Army

After listing the key warriors of his army, Duryodhana compares his forces to those of the Pandavas. He proudly declares that their army, protected by Grandsire Bhishma himself, is immeasurable and unconquerable.

In contrast, he considers the Pandava army, protected by Bhima, to be limited and easily conquerable. This displays his arrogance and confidence, but also reveals his underlying anxiety, as he feels the need to repeatedly assert his superiority.

## Commentary
**1.10**

Duryodhana's assessment reveals his insecurity. He is trying to reassure himself by relying on his vast army and the leadership of a great warrior like Bhishma. The word 'aparyāptam' can mean 'immeasurable' or 'insufficient', reflecting his inner conflict. By calling the Pandava army 'paryāptam' or 'limited', he is underestimating them, a grave mistake in warfare.
