# The Protection of Bhishma

After assessing the strength of his army, Duryodhana lays out the next phase of his strategy. He commands all his great warriors—like Drona, Kripacharya, Karna, and others—to remain steadfast in their designated positions.

His primary directive is that everyone must protect Grandfather **Bhishma** from all sides. Duryodhana knows that Bhishma is the most powerful pillar of his army, and his safety is paramount to the Kaurava victory. This highlights his strategic thinking, focusing on securing his most vital warrior.

Duryodhana addressed his commanders, "Stand firm at your strategic points, and with all your might, protect Grandfather Bhishma. He is the foundation of our army, and his safety will ensure our victory. The Pandavas will try to target him, but we must keep him secure at all costs. United, we are invincible."
