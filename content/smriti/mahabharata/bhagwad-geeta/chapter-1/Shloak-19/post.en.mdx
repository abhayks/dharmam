# Shattering the Hearts of the Kauravas

The simultaneous blowing of conches by all the warriors on the Pandava side produced a tremendous sound that was unprecedented. It was not just noise, but the roar of the power of dharma.

That tumultuous sound, vibrating through the sky and the earth, struck directly at the hearts of the sons of Dhritarashtra, the Kauravas. The confidence and power in the Pandavas' conch blasts were so immense that they severely broke the morale of the Kaurava army and filled their hearts with fear.

<ShlokaCard 
  sanskrit="स घोषो धार्तराष्ट्राणां हृदयानि व्यदारयत् ।
नभश्च पृथिवीं चैव तुमुलोऽभ्यनुनादयन् ॥"
  en="The tumultuous sound, vibrating through the sky and the earth, shattered the hearts of the sons of Dhritarashtra."
  hi="और उस भयानक शब्द ने आकाश और पृथ्वी को भी गुंजाते हुए धृतराष्ट्र के पक्षवालों के अर्थात् आपके पुत्रों के हृदय विदीर्ण कर दिए।"

## Commentary
**1.19**

While the uproar of the Kauravas was merely an external show, the conch blast of the Pandavas arose from inner strength and conviction. This sound became a weapon, shattering the confidence of the Kauravas even before the battle began. It demonstrates how terrifying the sound of dharma and truth can be to the unrighteous.
