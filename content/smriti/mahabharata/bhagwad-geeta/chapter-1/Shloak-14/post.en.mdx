# The Pandavas' Response

In answer to the tumultuous roar of the Kauravas, the Pandava side made its presence known. Seated on a magnificent chariot, drawn by white horses, were Lord Krishna (Madhava) and Arjuna (the son of Pandu).

This was no ordinary chariot; it was a divine chariot gifted to Arjuna by Agni, the fire god. From this chariot, both of them blew their respective transcendental conch shells. Their sound was divine and powerful, a stark contrast to the chaotic noise of the Kauravas. It symbolized the Pandavas' confidence and their firm stand for righteousness (dharma).

## Commentary
**1.14**

As the Kaurava noise subsided, a divine sound echoed. It came from the conches of Krishna and Arjuna, seated upon their grand chariot with white horses. This was not just a reply; it was a declaration. While the Kaurava noise was a display of numbers and arrogance, the Pandavas' conch blast signaled their divine purpose and unwavering resolve.
