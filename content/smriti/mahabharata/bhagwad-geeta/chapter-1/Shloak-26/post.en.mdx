# The Vision of Relatives

There, standing between the two armies, Arjuna saw. He didn't just see warriors; he saw his loved ones. He saw his paternal uncles, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, cousins, sons, grandsons, and friends.

He also saw his fathers-in-law and other well-wishers, spread across both sides. The battlefield looked like a family gathering, but it was a gathering where everyone had assembled to kill one another.

<ShlokaCard 
  sanskrit="तत्रापश्यत्स्थितान् पार्थः पितॄनथ पितामहान् ।
आचार्यान्मातुलान्भ्रातॄन्पुत्रान्पौत्रान्सखींस्तथा ॥"
  en="There Arjuna could see, within the midst of the armies of both parties, his fathers, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, friends..."
  hi="वहाँ अर्जुन ने दोनों ही सेनाओं में स्थित पितातुल्य पुरुषों, पितामहों, आचार्यों, मामाओं, भाइयों, पुत्रों, पौत्रों तथा मित्रों, ससुरों और शुभचिंतकों को भी देखा।"

## Commentary
**1.26**

This shloka marks the beginning of Arjuna's delusion. Until now, he was focused on his duty as a kshatriya. But now, as he sees the faces of his loved ones, his identity as a warrior is overshadowed by his identity as a relative—a son, a brother, a friend. It is this personal connection that will weaken his resolve and plunge him into deep sorrow.
