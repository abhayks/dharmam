# The Great Warriors of the Pandava Army

In addition to the Pandava brothers, other great warriors on their side also announced their presence in the battle by blowing their conches.

These included the King of Kashi, an excellent archer; Shikhandi, a great chariot-warrior; Dhrishtadyumna, the commander of the Pandava army; King Virata; and the unconquerable Satyaki. The participation of all these warriors showed that the Pandavas were not alone but were supported by many powerful kings and fighters.

## Commentary
**1.17**

This shloka highlights the depth and strength of the Pandava army. It was not just an army of five brothers but a coalition of many kingdoms and great warriors united for the cause of dharma. The presence of names like the King of Kashi, Shikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, and Satyaki sent a clear message to the Kauravas that they were facing a formidable and determined enemy.
