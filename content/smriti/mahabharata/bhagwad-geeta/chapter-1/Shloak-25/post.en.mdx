# Observing the Kurus

At Arjuna's request, Lord Krishna positioned the chariot at a spot that offered the most poignant view of the battlefield. The chariot stood directly in front of revered elders like Bhishma and Drona, and all the other kings.

The Lord then said, "O Partha, behold all these Kurus assembled here for battle." Krishna's statement seems simple, but it prompts Arjuna to face the reality he wished to avoid—that his opponents are none other than his own family.

<ShlokaCard 
  sanskrit="भीष्मद्रोणप्रमुखतः सर्वेषां च महीक्षिताम् ।
उवाच पार्थ पश्यैतान् समवेतान् कुरूनिति ॥"
  en="In the presence of Bhishma, Drona, and all the other chieftains of the world, the Lord said, 'Just behold, O Partha, all the Kurus assembled here.'"
  hi="भीष्म, द्रोण और उन सम्पूर्ण राजाओं के सामने उत्तम रथ को खड़ा करके भगवान श्रीकृष्ण इस प्रकार बोले कि हे पार्थ! युद्ध के लिए जुटे हुए इन कौरवों को देखो।"

## Commentary
**1.25**

Krishna deliberately placed the chariot in front of Bhishma and Drona. He wanted Arjuna to see not just an enemy army, but the faces of his grandsire and his teacher. By saying, "Behold these Kurus," Krishna is reminding Arjuna of his personal relationships. This is the psychological stage where Arjuna's conflict between attachment and duty will reach its peak.
