# The Dilemma of the Aggressor

Arjuna uses a specific legal term here: **Atatayinah** (Aggressors). In the Vedic scriptures, an *Atatayi* is someone who sets fire to a house, administers poison, attacks with a weapon, steals wealth, steals land, or kidnaps a wife. The Kauravas had done **all** of these to the Pandavas.

Normally, killing an aggressor is permitted. But Arjuna argues that because these aggressors are his own kinsmen (`Svabandhavan`), the act of killing them will result in sin, not justice.

<ShlokaCard 
  sanskrit="पापमेवाश्रयेदस्मान्हत्वैतानाततायिनः ।
तस्मान्नार्हा वयं हन्तुं धार्तराष्ट्रान्स्वबान्धवान् ।
स्वजनं हि कथं हत्वा सुखिनः स्याम माधव ॥"
  en="Sin will overcome us if we slay such aggressors. Therefore it is not proper for us to kill the sons of Dhritarashtra and our friends. What should we gain, O Krishna, husband of the goddess of fortune, and how could we be happy by killing our own kinsmen?"
  hi="इन आतताइयों को मारकर हमें पाप ही लगेगा। अतएव अपने बान्धव धृतराष्ट्र के पुत्रों को मारने के लिए हम योग्य नहीं हैं; क्योंकि अपने ही कुटुम्ब को मारकर हम कैसे सुखी होंगे, हे माधव?"

## Description
**1.36**

"They are aggressors, this is true,<br />
They poisoned, burned, and stole from you.<br />
By law, their lives are forfeited,<br />
But I see brothers there instead.

If we strike down this evil crew,<br />
We slay our family history too.<br />
Upon our hands, the blood will stick,<br />
Making the soul within us sick.

O Madhava, Lord of Fortune's grace,<br />
How can we find a happy place?<br />
If we cut down our very root,<br />
How can we taste the sweet fruit?

To kill a stranger brings no stain,<br />
But killing kin brings endless pain.<br />
Sin shall cling to us like a shroud,<br />
If we destroy this family crowd."
