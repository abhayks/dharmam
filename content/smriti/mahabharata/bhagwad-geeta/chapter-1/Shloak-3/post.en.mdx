# The Politics of War

Duryodhana speaks to Dronacharya with calculated diplomacy. He draws attention to the vast Pandava army, specifically mentioning that it has been arranged by Dhrishtadyumna (the son of Drupada).

This is a subtle taunt. Dhrishtadyumna was born to kill Drona, yet Drona—bound by his duty as a teacher—taught him the military arts anyway. Duryodhana is reminding Drona of this "mistake" to ensure Drona fights without leniency.

व्यूढां द्रुपदपुत्रेण तव शिष्येण धीमता ॥"

## Description
**1.3**

Now Duryodhana’s voice grew sharp and cold,<br />
Reminding the teacher of stories old.<br />
He pointed a finger across the sand,<br />
Where the enemy forces had taken their stand.

"Behold, O Master," the prince began,<br />
"The work of a wise and skillful man.<br />
Look at the Pandava lines so vast,<br />
Shadows of choices from your own past.

Who leads their formation with such fine art?<br />
Who arranged their spears to pierce our heart?<br />
It is Drupada’s son, whom you taught so well,<br />
The student who learned the secrets of hell.

You gave him your knowledge, you gave him your skill,<br />
Knowing his destiny was to kill.<br />
Now see how your wisdom returns to the field,<br />
To test if your armor effectively yields.

Your intelligent pupil has set the stage,<br />
To trap his own master in battles of rage.<br />
Observe, O Acharya, this irony deep,<br />
Before the first arrows resolve to leap."
