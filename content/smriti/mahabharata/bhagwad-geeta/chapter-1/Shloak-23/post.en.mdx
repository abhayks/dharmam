# Observing Duryodhana's Supporters

Arjuna clarifies his point further, saying, "I want to see those who have gathered here to please the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra in battle."

Arjuna's use of the term "evil-minded" shows that he clearly understands the injustice of Duryodhana's cause. Yet, he is perplexed to see that so many respected warriors and relatives are also prepared to support unrighteousness.

## Commentary
**1.23**

This shloka deepens Arjuna's internal conflict. He is not just cataloging warriors; he is making a moral judgment. He is distressed that so many people who should be upholding dharma are standing on the side of adharma. This observation will become a key reason for his subsequent grief, as he will see his own loved ones among these people.
