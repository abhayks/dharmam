# The Collapse of the Warrior

Upon seeing his fathers, grandfathers, teachers, and friends destined for death, Arjuna's spirit breaks. He describes a classic panic response. The great warrior who could single-handedly defeat armies is now unable to even stand.

<ShlokaCard 
  sanskrit="अर्जुन उवाच ।
दृष्ट्वेमं स्वजनं कृष्ण युयुत्सुं समुपस्थितम् ।
सीदन्ति मम गात्राणि मुखं च परिशुष्यति ॥"
  en="Arjuna said: My dear Krishna, seeing my friends and relatives present before me in such a fighting spirit, I feel the limbs of my body quivering and my mouth drying up."
  hi="अर्जुन बोले: हे कृष्ण! युद्ध क्षेत्र में डटे हुए युद्ध के अभिलाषी इस स्वजन-समुदाय को देखकर मेरे अंग शिथिल हुए जा रहे हैं और मुख सूखा जा रहा है।"

## Description
**1.28 – 1.29**

The sight of faces loved and known,<br />
Dissolved the strength in muscle and bone.<br />
The warrior looked upon his kin,<br />
And felt a dying fire within.

"O Krishna," cried the archer’s voice,<br />
"How can my heart make this choice?<br />
To see them standing, ready to die,<br />
Drains the light from my spirit’s eye.

My limbs are weak, like water flowing,<br />
My mouth is dry, no courage showing.<br />
A fever burns beneath my skin,<br />
As grief and horror begin to win.

See how I tremble, see how I shake,<br />
My soul is crushing for their sake.<br />
The Gandiva bow, which conquered lands,<br />
Is slipping from my sweating hands."
