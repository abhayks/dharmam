# The Worthlessness of the Prize

Arjuna first lists the specific social roles of the men standing against him—teachers, grandfathers, and uncles. He then makes a grand declaration to Krishna (addressing Him as **Madhusudana**, the killer of the Madhu demon).

Arjuna states that even if he were offered dominion over the **Three Worlds** (Heaven, Earth, and the Subterranean), he would not kill his kin to gain it. Therefore, killing them just for a piece of this "insignificant" Earth seems utterly foolish to him.

## Description
**1.34 – 1.35**

"Look who stands within my sight,<br />
Challenging me to this fatal fight.<br />
Teachers, uncles, grandsires tall,<br />
The very pillars of my hall.

They may strike with intent to kill,<br />
But I possess no answering will.<br />
O Slayer of Madhu, hear my vow,<br />
I will not bend my spirit now.

If you offered the Heavens high,<br />
Where gods and stars adorn the sky,<br />
Or rule of all the worlds combined,<br />
I would not leave my kin behind.

If universal power is not enough,<br />
To make me do a deed so rough,<br />
Then why for this small, blood-stained earth,<br />
Should I destroy my family's worth?"
