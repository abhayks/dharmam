# Krishna's Response

Sanjaya continues, telling Dhritarashtra: "O descendant of Bharata (Dhritarashtra)! Thus addressed by Arjuna (Gudakesha, the conqueror of sleep), Lord Krishna (Hrishikesha) drove that finest of chariots and placed it right in the middle of the two armies."

Lord Krishna, the master of the universe, humbly plays His role as the charioteer of a devotee. He immediately complies with Arjuna's request, demonstrating the loving relationship between the Lord and His devotee.

## Commentary
**1.24**

This shloka highlights the greatness and grace of the Lord. Despite being all-powerful, He honors the wish of His devotee and performs His duty as a charioteer. Krishna's act of placing the chariot in the middle is symbolic. It provides a stage for Arjuna to confront the reality of the war, from where his delusion and grief will peak, leading to the dawn of the Gita's wisdom.
