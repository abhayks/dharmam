## Description
**1.21 – 1.22**

The Prince of Pandus raised his bow,<br />
And watched the armies ebb and flow.<br />
With confidence in every breath,<br />
He sought to gauge the scale of death.

"O Achyuta," he told his guide,<br />
"Take me where the lands divide.<br />
Drive my chariot to the space,<br />
Between the lines of war and grace.

Stand there amidst the gathering storm,<br />
While I observe the enemy's form.<br />
Let me see the face of hate,<br />
Those who rush to meet their fate.

Who has come to please the king?<br />
Who desires the ruin we bring?<br />
Before my arrows start their flight,<br />
I wish to measure out the fight."
