# The Roll Call of Warriors

Duryodhana continues his assessment of the enemy forces. He lists the great kings and warriors who have gathered to fight for Yudhishthira. By comparing them to Bhima and Arjuna, he acknowledges their immense strength.

All the warriors mentioned here are **Maharathas**—warriors capable of fighting ten thousand archers single-handedly.

## Description
**1.4 – 1.6**

The prince’s eyes, with fearful scanning gaze,<br />
Counted the heroes through the morning haze.<br />
He named them one by one, a deadly list,<br />
Emerging from the dawn’s dissipating mist.

"See there," he cried, "where Yuyudhana stands,<br />
With bow as strong as Bhima’s crushing hands.<br />
And King Virata, in whose court they hid,<br />
Now stands revealed for all the deeds he did.

See Drupada, the father of our foe,<br />
Burning with age-old fire and martial glow.<br />
And Dhrishtaketu, brave and firm of heart,<br />
Ready to tear our battle lines apart.

The King of Kashi, strong in every limb,<br />
And Kuntibhoja—death walks close to him.<br />
See Shaibya, noble bull among the men,<br />
Ready to charge the lion in his den.

Look at the sons!" the Kaurava prince exclaimed,<br />
"Abhimanyu, whom the Lord Krishna trained.<br />
And Draupadi’s young lions, five in line,<br />
Seeking vengeance for their mother’s shrine.

They represent a forest of raised swords,<br />
Not simple soldiers, but the highest lords.<br />
Maharathas all! A storm of iron and fire,<br />
Gathered to build my army's funeral pyre."
