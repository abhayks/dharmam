# The Pillars of the Kaurava Army

Duryodhana continues to list his commanders. He specifically names **Kripacharya** as *Samitinjaya* (ever-victorious in battle). He also mentions **Vikarna**, his only brother who actually questioned the disrobing of Draupadi, yet fights for Duryodhana out of loyalty.

In Verse 9, Duryodhana uses the phrase *tyakta-jivitah* ("ready to give up their lives"). While he means they are brave enough to risk death, it is often interpreted as an unconscious prophecy—that all these men are indeed destined to die for his ambition.

## Description
**1.8 – 1.9**

"First you," he said, "the Brahmin warrior priest,<br />
And Bhishma, like a lion from the east.<br />
See Karna there, the sun-god’s radiant son,<br />
And Kripa, who has never lost a battle run.

There stands Ashwatthama, immortal, strong,<br />
And my brother Vikarna, amidst the throng.<br />
See Bhurishrava, Somadatta’s heir,<br />
Heroes breathing fire in the morning air.

And countless more!" the ambitious prince cried out,<br />
"Who joined my cause without a single doubt.<br />
They hold their spears and maces in the sky,<br />
For me alone, they are prepared to die.

Skilled in the arts of every fatal blow,<br />
They know the way the river of blood must flow.<br />
They’ve cast aside the hope of life and breath,<br />
To crown me king or follow me to death."
