# Of What Use is a Kingdom?

Arjuna's confusion turns into a philosophical rejection of materialism. He argues that victory (`Vijayam`), kingdom (`Rajyam`), and pleasures (`Sukhani`) are only valuable if they can be shared with loved ones. If the war kills the very people one wishes to share prosperity with, then that prosperity is bitter and meaningless.

He addresses Krishna as **Govinda**, appealing to the aspect of the Lord who gives pleasure, asking how such an act could possibly bring satisfaction.

<ShlokaCard 
  sanskrit="न काङ्क्षे विजयं कृष्ण न च राज्यं सुखानि च ।
किं नो राज्येन गोविन्द किं भोगैर्जीवितेन वा ॥"
  en="O Krishna, I do not desire victory, nor kingdom, nor pleasures. Of what avail is a kingdom to us, O Govinda, or enjoyments, or even life itself?"
  hi="हे कृष्ण! मैं न तो विजय चाहता हूँ और न राज्य तथा सुखों को ही। हे गोविन्द! हमें ऐसे राज्य से क्या प्रयोजन है अथवा ऐसे भोगों से और जीवन से भी क्या लाभ है?"

## Description
**1.32**

"O Krishna, take away this crown,<br />
I will not strike my kinsmen down.<br />
I crave no victory, seek no throne,<br />
If I must rule a world alone.

What is a kingdom, but dust and stone,<br />
If built upon a brother’s bone?<br />
What is pleasure, what is gold,<br />
If hands are dead and hearts are cold?

O Govinda, you who give us joy,<br />
Why ask me to destroy?<br />
What use is life, what use is breath,<br />
If all it buys is family death?

I cast aside this bloody prize,<br />
It holds no value in my eyes.<br />
For power gained through such a sin,<br />
Is the hollowest way a man can win."
