# Compassion and Grief

When Arjuna saw all those friends and relatives on the battlefield, his heart melted. The firm resolve of a great warrior was drowned in an ocean of compassion.

He became overwhelmed with "utmost compassion" and, sinking into deep sorrow, he began to speak. This is a crucial aspect of his character—he is not a hard-hearted warrior but a sensitive soul who feels a deep connection to his loved ones.

## Commentary
**1.27**

Arjuna's grief is not a sign of weakness, but a testament to his humanity. The words "parayā kṛpayā" (with utmost compassion) are significant. They show that his reaction stems not from panic, but from deep love and attachment. This very compassion, which seems like an obstacle at this moment, will later become the foundation for understanding Krishna's teachings.
