# Bhishma's Lion's Roar

Hearing Duryodhana's words, the eldest and most powerful warrior of the Kaurava army, Grandsire Bhishma, decides to encourage him. He knew that doubt and fear lingered in Duryodhana's heart.

Therefore, Bhishma let out a roar as mighty as a lion's and then blew his conch with great force. His roar and the sound of his conch were meant to bring joy to Duryodhana and boost the morale of the Kaurava army. This was the first formal declaration of war from the Kaurava side.

<ShlokaCard 
  sanskrit="तस्य सञ्जनयन् हर्षं कुरुवृद्धः पितामहः ।
सिंहनादं विनद्योच्चैः शङ्खं दध्मौ प्रतापवान् ॥"
  en="Then, the great valiant grandsire of the Kuru dynasty, the glorious Bhishma, roared like a lion and blew his conch shell very loudly, giving joy to Duryodhana."
  hi="कौरवों में वृद्ध बड़े प्रतापी पितामह भीष्म ने उस दुर्योधन के हृदय में हर्ष उत्पन्न करते हुए उच्च स्वर से सिंह की दहाड़ के समान गरजकर शंख बजाया।"
