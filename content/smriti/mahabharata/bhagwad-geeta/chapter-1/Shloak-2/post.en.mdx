# The Reaction of Duryodhana

Sanjaya begins his narration. He reports that Dhritarashtra's son, Duryodhana, despite having a larger army, feels unsettled by the military formation of the Pandavas. He immediately seeks reassurance from his Guru, Dronacharya.

<ShlokaCard 
  sanskrit="दृष्ट्वा तु पाण्डवानीकं व्यूढं दुर्योधनस्तदा ।
आचार्यमुपसंगम्य राजा वचनमब्रवीत् ॥"
  en="Sanjaya said: But then, seeing the army of the Pandavas drawn up in battle array, King Duryodhana approached his teacher and spoke these words."
  hi="संजय बोले: उस समय राजा दुर्योधन ने व्यूह रचना से खड़ी पाण्डवों की सेना को देखकर और द्रोणाचार्य के पास जाकर यह वचन कहा।"

## Description
**1.2**

The voice of Sanjaya, calm and clear,<br />
Replied to the king in his hall of fear.<br />
He saw the field where the banners flew,<br />
And spoke of the son the old king knew.

“O King,” he said, “your son has seen<br />
The Pandava lines, precise and keen.<br />
Their forces stand in a fortress wall,<br />
A tiger’s trap to make him fall.

Though Duryodhana is named the king,<br />
And holds the crown and the signet ring,<br />
His heart is struck by a sudden chill,<br />
Seeing the strength of his cousins' will.

He does not turn to his generals bold,<br />
Nor Bhishma, wise and centuries old.<br />
Instead, he seeks his teacher’s side,<br />
Where Drona stands in martial pride.

Like a child who fears the gathering storm,<br />
Or a snake who strikes when the grass is warm,<br />
He goes to the master of war and art,<br />
To hide the tremor within his heart.”
