# Ill Omens and a Pointless Victory

Expressing his despair, Arjuna says, "O Keshava, I see only inauspicious omens. I do not see any good or welfare in killing my own kinsmen in this battle."

His mind is now interpreting everything negatively. The war that previously seemed necessary for establishing dharma now appears to be only a cause for destruction. He is questioning the value of a victory that would be achieved through the blood of his own people.

<ShlokaCard 
  sanskrit="निमित्तानि च पश्यामि विपरीतानि केशव ।
न च श्रेयोऽनुपश्यामि हत्वा स्वजनमाहवे ॥"
  en="I see only causes of misfortune, O Keshava, and I do not see how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle."
  hi="हे केशव! मैं लक्षणों को भी विपरीत ही देख रहा हूँ तथा युद्ध में स्वजन-समुदाय को मारकर कल्याण भी नहीं देखता।"

## Commentary
**1.31**

This is the beginning of Arjuna's reasoning. He is now finding reasons to justify his grief. "Na ca śreyaḥ" (no good) becomes his central argument. He is evaluating the action based on its consequence. If the result (death of kinsmen) is terrible, how can the action (war) be good? This is a powerful moral dilemma that Krishna will have to address.
