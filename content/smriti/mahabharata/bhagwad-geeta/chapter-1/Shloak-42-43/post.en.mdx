# Jati and Kula Dharma

Arjuna distinguishes between two types of laws here:
1.  **Jati-dharma:** Community or caste duties (social responsibilities).
2.  **Kula-dharma:** Family traditions (religious/ethical responsibilities).

He argues that war destroys both. When the "dynasty destroyers" create social chaos, these ancient, unwritten laws vanish. Without these guiding principles, humans are condemned to dwell in a "hellish" state (`Narake`)—either literally in the afterlife or metaphorically in a lawless society.

## Description
**1.42 – 1.43**

"By these foul sins that break the line,
We shatter laws that are divine.
The ancient codes of clan and caste,
Are swept away by war’s cold blast.

When family rites are cast aside,
Where does the human soul abide?
Without the anchor of the past,
The ship of life is sinking fast.

O Janardana, I have heard it said,
By wise men speaking of the dead:
That those who break the sacred trust,
Are ground to powder and to dust.

Condemned to dwell in hells unknown,
For overturning what was sown.
A lawless life, a darker fate,
Is all that lies beyond this gate."
