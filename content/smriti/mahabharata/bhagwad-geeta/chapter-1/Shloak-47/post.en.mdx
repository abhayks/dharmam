# The End of Chapter 1

Since the narrative action concluded in the previous verse with Arjuna collapsing in grief, this final entry serves as the **Colophon** (Pushpika).

Every chapter of the Gita ends with this specific formula, affirming that this text is:
1.  **Brahma-vidya:** The Science of the Absolute.
2.  **Yoga-shastra:** The Scripture of Yoga.
3.  **Samvade:** A dialogue between the Infinite (Krishna) and the Finite (Arjuna).

<ShlokaCard 
  sanskrit="ॐ तत्सदिति श्रीमद्भगवद्गीतासूपनिषत्सु ब्रह्मविद्यायां योगशास्त्रे श्रीकृष्णार्जुनसंवादे अर्जुनविषादयोगो नाम प्रथमोऽध्यायः ॥"
  en="Om Tat Sat. Thus, in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, in the Science of the Eternal, in the Scripture of Yoga, in the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the first chapter named: The Yoga of Arjuna's Dejection."
  hi="ॐ तत्सत। इस प्रकार श्रीमद्भगवद्गीतारूपी उपनिषद् एवं ब्रह्मविद्या तथा योगशास्त्र विषयक श्रीकृष्ण और अर्जुन के संवाद में 'अर्जुनविषादयोग' नामक पहला अध्याय पूर्ण होता है।"

## Description
**Chapter 1 Conclusion**

Thus ends the **Arjuna Vishada Yoga** (The Yoga of Dejection).

It may seem strange to call "Dejection" or "Grief" a Yoga. How can sadness be a path to God?

This chapter is a Yoga because Arjuna's grief is **honest**. He has stripped away his arrogance and his illusions. He has admitted he is confused and helpless. This "emptying of the cup" is the necessary first step. Only when one is completely empty of ego and confidence can one be filled with Divine Wisdom.

Arjuna is now ready to listen. The student is ready; the Teacher (in Chapter 2) will now begin to speak.
