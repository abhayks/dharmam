# The Mahabharata

The **Mahabharata** is the longest epic poem known and has been described as "the longest poem ever written". It is roughly ten times the length of the Iliad and the Odyssey combined.

It narrates the struggle between two groups of cousins in the Kurukshetra War and the fates of the Kaurava and the Pandava princes.

## Structure
The epic is divided into **18 Parvas** (Books). Embedded within the *Bhishma Parva* is the **Bhagavad Gita**, the spiritual heart of the epic.
