# The Living Tradition

**Smriti** (Sanskrit: स्मृति, literally "that which is remembered") refers to a body of Hindu texts that are attributed to an author, as opposed to **Shruti** (the Vedas), which are considered authorless and eternal.

While Shruti represents the eternal, unchanging truth, Smriti is the application of that truth to changing times and societies. It is the dynamic, living aspect of the Dharma.



## Major Categories
Smriti literature is vast and diverse, covering history, law, and lore:

1.  **Itihasa (History):** The great epics—**Mahabharata** and **Ramayana**—which teach the four goals of life through narrative.
2.  **Puranas (Ancient Lore):** 18 major Mahapuranas that preserve cosmology, genealogy of gods/kings, and folk tales.
3.  **Dharma Shastras (Law):** Codes of conduct and law, such as the *Manusmriti* or *Yajnavalkya Smriti*.
4.  **Agamas & Tantras:** Manuals for worship, temple construction, and rituals.
